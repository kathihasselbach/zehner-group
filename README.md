# Zehner Group: Dev Exercise
This repository contains the files for the coding exercise with Zehner Group.

The mockup for the coding exercise can be found here https://www.figma.com/file/cVzImwKchhNv8cXmY7teFa/Dev-Test?node-id=1%3A729

## Task
- Code the above mockup in a limited time of 3-4 hours
- Develop the page using HTML, vanilla Javascript (or jQuery if necessary), and CSS or SCSS.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS (no Bootstrap)
- jQuery

## Structure
- `index.html` is the index files for this exercise
- `css/styles.css` styling for this exercise
- `js/script.js` javascript (jQuery) for this exercise
- `/icons` contains all icons
- `/images` contains all images

## Instructions
### Clone project
```sh
git clone https://github.com/kathihasselbach/zehner-group.git
cd zehner-group
```
## What is Completed?
- Menu is responsive
- Search opens when click on magnifier and closes when click on X
- Submenu opens when hovering over menu item
- Submenu changes image on the right when hovering over submenu item

## Design Questions
- What happens with the top-header (black) when scrolling down on the page?
- What happens with the header when scrolling down? Is it fixed and always visible or is it only visible when user is on top of the page?
- Where is the country switch on mobile?

## What is Missing and would be done with more time?
- Country (language): I would have added a dropdown to switch between the conutry options
- Main Content: I would have added all the content (images, icons and text) and styled it accordingly to the mockup
- Footer: I would have added all the content (images, icoss and text) and styled it accordingly to the mockup
- Correct font-family: unfortunately Century Gothic is not available for free on Google Fonts, so I have used the font-family Mulish, which is the closest to Century Gothic on Google Fonts
- Final step would be to minimze the css file to save page speed load time
